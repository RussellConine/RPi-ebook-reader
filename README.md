### By Russell Conine

## Description

This program operates on a Raspberry Pi, and will receive input from 6 pushbuttons to control the playing of audiobooks. The user can start and pause the player; fast forward and rewind; and change between books. The program will read the name and number (based on alphabetical order of the books stored) of the book aloud when it is chosen.

The program and interface were created to allow someone with visual difficulties to easily control the player, through the use of large, brightly lit buttons and audible feedback of selections.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Setup Main.py to run at startup. Store audiobooks on flashdrive in format:
War and Peace-Part01.mp3
